## Key Features 🔑

1. **Database Operations:**
   - **Create Database:** Users can create new databases.
   - **Drop Database:** Existing databases can be deleted.

2. **Table Operations:**
   - **Create Table:** Tables can be created within databases, with customizable attributes and primary keys.
   - **Drop Table:** Users can delete tables from databases.
   - **Insert Data:** Data can be inserted into tables, populating them with records.
   - **Delete Data:** Users can delete specific records or entire rows from tables.

3. **Indexing:**
   - **Create Index:** Indexes can be created on tables to improve query performance.
  
4.  **Visual editor:**
    - **Insert Data:** Data can be inserted with a visual editor into the MongoDB collection.
    - **Delete Data:** The user can delete the data from the MongoDB via selecting the row.
  
5. **Selection:**
   - **Select Data:** Users can retrieve specific data from tables based on specified conditions using SQL SELECT statements.
   - **Filtering:** Data retrieval can be filtered using WHERE clauses.
   - **Grouping:** Retrieved data can be grouped based on specific attributes using GROUP BY clauses.
   - **Aggregate Functions:** Users can perform aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., on selected data.
   - **Joins:** Tables can be joined together based on common attributes to retrieve combined data.
